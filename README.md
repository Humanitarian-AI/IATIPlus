The [Humanitarian AI](https://humanitarianai.org/) meetup community is launching a community-wide **call-to-action** seeking volunteers to work on quickly setting up a new IATI database to support relief efforts aiding Ukrainian refugees and IDPs.

## IATI

IATI is an XML standard humanitarian organizations use to openly share information on aid activities, transactions and results in granular detail. Reporting activities in compliance with IATI helps improve operational transparency, benefitting operational planning, fundraising and coordination across organizations and across crisis theaters. However, IATI's backend infrastructure isn't setup to power sophisticated new machine applications.

## Project

As a proof-of-concept project supported by Amazon's AWS Nonprofit Credit Program, we're going to setup a Neptune graph database to store a daily-updated copy of IATI's entire corpus configured to support the applicational needs of organizations, initiatives and AI developers responding to the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis.

Unlike conventional IATI data sources, our database (IATI Plus) will be robust enough to support sophisticated research initiatives and power new prototype applications running at scale. **IATI Plus** will give organizations the ability to not only query IATI's entire corpus using virtually any combination of IATI's hundreds of information fields but test the usefulness of new information fields and give organizations the ability to incorporate non-IATI data into the database, creating extra nodes and relationships expanding the database's question-answering potential.

## Mission

Through our volunteer project, we aim to try to support organizations responding to the Ukrainian crisis and help incentivize more organizations to channel aid activity information through open data sharing frameworks which humanitarian AI applications are going to increasingly rely on as data sources.

## Get Involved

The Humanitarian AI meetup community is seeking volunteers of all levels to help work on setting up **IATI Plus** and to help organizations use and channel aid activity information through the database. To join the project, contact: **team (at) humanitarianai.org**

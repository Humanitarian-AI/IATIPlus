## IATI Plus Data

IATI Plus' Neptune graph database will store a continuously updated copy of IATI's entire **corpus**. The corpus contains all know information reported by relief organizations in compliance with the IATI Standard (roughly information on over one million aid activities reported by over 1400 organizations). The database will also store a small amount of non-IATI data imported from the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) and other sources as well as useful codelists and correlation tables.

## Data Sources

A updated IATI corpus is stored in a [daily data dump](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Resources/IATI-Dropbox.md) folder generated by [Code for IATI](https://codeforiati.org/). We will use this data source to initially populate our Neptune database and potentially aftewards to continiusly refresh it. But we will also research and test ways of monitoring updates made to IATI files by organizations and ways of extracting new file information from IATI, from IATI connected [tools and resources](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-tools-and-resources/) and directly from organization servers.

Developing our own reliable data extraction capabilities will enable us to experiment with shortening intervals between data updates, to meet the future needs of sophisticated new IATI applications operating at scale for example. [Sprint 01]() will contribute to these end and tackle how we can keep an up-to-date list of all known IATI XML files published by organizations on their servers and the website addresses of these files.

### Additional Data Sources

The project will examine how adding **nodes** and **relationships** to the database taken from IATI and non-IATI **codelists** and **correlation tables** can aid inforamtion retrieval and expand IATI Plus informational outputs.


## Data Structure

![IATI Data Structure](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATI_data_structure.png)

Using the IATI Registry and IATI XML files for reference, IATI mainly organizes information by **organizations** then by **activities**. Although organization datasets can contain mulitple XML files (each accessible via their own separate URL address), each containing information on potentially multiple different activities, IATI data can be structured mainly around **organizations**, **organization**, **activities**, **activity** and **field** nodes.

![IATI Authors](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATI_authors.png)

As an option, we might want to add author nodes between individual aid activities and their activity fields, facilitating activity field co-creation down to the individual key-value pair level.

## Sprint 02 Key Tasks

Initially, we will need to tackle how the graphical structure of our Neptune graph database will look and then resolve how to populate the databse with an IATI corpus from Code of IATI's Data Dump.

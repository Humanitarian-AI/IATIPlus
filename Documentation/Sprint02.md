# Sprint 02

![IATI Plus Database](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATIPlus_sprints.png)

**Sprint 02** will concentrate on tackling how to source IATI data stored in organization datasets. See Care Nepal's [dataset](https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher/cnepal) for reference or Oxfam GB's [dataset](https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher/oxfamgb) to see one with more files. Datasets contain one **organization** XML file (orange) and one or more **activity** XML files (light-blue). Activity files can contain information on one or more individual activities, each with their own unique reference identifier. Granular activity information is then broken-down using standardized information fields. For testing, the project is going to try adding **author** attributes to information field elements, essentially breaking information down further.

After tacking how to source and load initial data, Sprint 02 will tackle how to keep **IATI Plus** up-to-date through continuously tracking and updating file information and logging changes. Volunteers can refer to [Key Tasks](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/Tasks.md) to learn more about weekly priority tasks and how to get involved.


## IATI Plus Data Types

IATI Plus' Neptune graph database will store a continuously updated copy of IATI's entire **corpus**. The corpus contains all know information reported by relief organizations in compliance with the IATI Standard (roughly information on over one million aid activities reported by over 1400 organizations). The database will also store a small amount of non-IATI data imported from the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/), [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/) and other sources as well as useful codelists and correlation tables.

Adding specialized **codelists** and **correlation tables** to IATI Plus will make it possible to research how to improve the database's traversability by machine applications. Likewise, adding select data from non-IATI sources will make it possible to research ways of enhancing informational outputs through partnering with other data sources, improving the database's overall usefulness to the humanitarian community.
 

## IATI Data Sources

![IATI Data Dump](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATI_datadump.png)

A updated IATI corpus is stored in a [daily data dump](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Resources/IATI-Dropbox.md) folder generated by [Code for IATI](https://codeforiati.org/). We will use this data source to initially populate our Neptune database and potentially afterwards to continuously refresh it. But we will also research and test ways of monitoring updates made to IATI files by organizations and ways of extracting new file information from IATI, from IATI connected [tools and resources](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-tools-and-resources/) and directly from organization servers.

Developing our own reliable data extraction capabilities will enable us to experiment with shortening intervals between data updates, to meet the future needs of sophisticated new IATI applications operating at scale for example. [Sprint 01]() will contribute to these ends and tackle how we can keep an up-to-date list of all known IATI XML files published by organizations on their servers and the website addresses of these files.

## Organization and Activity Files

IATI data is stored in organization and activity files. Activity files detail information on aid activities whereas organization files provide information about organizations themselves and their budgets to help support financial tracking, as the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) was originally launched mainly to track development aid flows. 

Below is a simplifed organization XML file. An official IATI example organization file can be found [here](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/organisation-standard/example-xml/).

```XML
<!--iati-organisations starts-->
<iati-organisations generated-datetime="2014-09-10T07:15:37Z" version="2.03">
  <!--iati-organisation starts-->
  <iati-organisation default-currency="EUR" last-updated-datetime="2014-09-10T07:15:37Z" xml:lang="en">
    <!--organisation-identifier starts-->
    <organisation-identifier>AA-AAA-123456789</organisation-identifier>
    <!--organisation-identifier ends-->
    <!--name starts-->
    <name>
      <narrative>Organisation one name</narrative>
    </name>
    <!--name ends-->
  </iati-organisation>
  <!--iati-organisation ends-->
</iati-organisations>
<!--iati-organisations ends-->
```

## Activity Files

Below is a simplified activity XML file breaking out two separate activities. An official IATI example activity file can be found [here](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/example-xml/).

```XML
<!--activities starts-->
<iati-activities generated-datetime="2014-09-10T07:15:37Z" version="2.03" linked-data-default="http://data.example.org/">
  <!--iati-activity starts-->
  <iati-activity xml:lang="en" default-currency="USD" last-updated-datetime="2014-09-10T07:15:37Z" humanitarian="1" linked-data-uri="http://data.example.org/123456789" hierarchy="1" budget-not-provided="1">
    <!--iati-identifier starts-->
    <iati-identifier>AA-AAA-123456789-ABC123</iati-identifier>
    <!--iati-identifier ends-->
    <!--reporting-org starts-->
    <reporting-org ref="AA-AAA-123456789" type="40" secondary-reporter="0">
      <narrative>Organisation one name</narrative>
    </reporting-org>
    <!--reporting-org ends-->
    <!--title starts-->
    <title>
      <narrative>Activity title</narrative>
    </title>
    <!--title ends-->
  </iati-activity>
  <!--iati-activity ends-->
  <!--iati-activity starts-->
  <iati-activity xml:lang="en" default-currency="USD" last-updated-datetime="2014-09-10T07:15:37Z" humanitarian="1" linked-data-uri="http://data.example.org/123456789" hierarchy="1" budget-not-provided="1">

    <!--iati-identifier ends-->
    <!--reporting-org starts-->
    <reporting-org ref="AA-AAA-123456789" type="40" secondary-reporter="0">
      <narrative>Organisation one name</narrative>
    </reporting-org>
    <!--reporting-org ends-->
    <!--title starts-->
    <title>
      <narrative>Activity title</narrative>
    </title>
    <!--title ends-->
  </iati-activity>
  <!--iati-activity ends-->
</iati-activities>
<!--activities ends-->

## Data Storage

IATI Plus data extractors will execute from AWS EC2 or Lambda instances and ultimately directly update the project's Neptune graph database. Initially, the project will look at potentially extracting, cleaning and storing test data in a S3 bucket while setup work on the database is being carried out.

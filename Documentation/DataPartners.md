# Data Partners Program

A vast and growing number of nonprofits, non-government aid organizations, United Nations organizations, government agencies and grassroots initiatives are responding to the war in Ukraine and the immense and urgent needs of millions of individuals impacted by the crisis.

Volunteers from the Humanitarian AI meetup community are launching a **Data Partners Program** to help aid providers of all types get acquainted with IATI and get started reporting their aid activities in compliance with the IATI Standard using platforms like **IATI Plus** and [AidStream](https://aidstream.org/).

The program will concentrate on helping aid providers make their work and needs more visible to donors and other organizations, increasing support for their work and improving operational coordination in the field, and on giving organizations a unique opportunity to get involved in helping develop and train emerging humanitarian AI applications.

## AI Training and Testing

Over 1400 organizations have channeled information on over one million aid activities through IATI's open data sharing framework. In order to develop and train next-generation artificial intelligent applications how to process IATI data and answer complex queries posed by humanitarian actors, a vast amount of work needs to be carried out to fill gaps in IATI data needed to train machine learning models and work out how models can traverse IATI information fields.

The Data Partners Program will give organizations an opportunity to work with students, researchers and AI developers on helping fill IATI data gaps using information on their own operations and on generating test queries and evaluating informational outputs generated by experimental machine learning models.

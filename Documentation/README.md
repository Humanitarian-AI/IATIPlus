# Project Documentation

Altogether, we will be setting up a **graph database** to store IATI data, working out how to keep the database up-to-date, building a **user interface** supporting aid activity reporting and establishing a [Data Partners Program](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/DataPartners.md).

The project is organized around **Sprints** that teams can work on simultaneously. We'll use a Google Doc ([Tasks-Issues-Discussion](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xUJVYvpIOpvYXDZuZ9LRegdA7aryA1oKWyKeZcw0i3o/edit?usp=sharing)) to help coordinate tasks in detail and maintain a weekly [Priority Task List](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/Tasks.md) for easy reference.

## Sprints

**Sprint 01:** Will create, store and programmatically update two CSV files. One CSV file will store an up-to-date copy of IATI's **Publishers List** and the other CSV file will store the URL addresses of all known IATI XML files published by organizations reporting activities in compliance with IATI. [Sprint01 Documentation](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/Sprint01.md)

**Sprint 02:** Will tackle how to aggregate IATI data and keep our graph database up-to-date. We will research two methodologies, one relying on extracting data directly from XML files stored on organizations and third-party web servers and another way relying on extracting IATI data from a daily **Data Dump**.

**Sprint 03:** Will setup and maintain the project's graph database. The sprint will design and build the database and work out how to query it. The sprint will also research and establish the database's graphical structure and begin work on developing and testing basic and advanced Cypher query strings. [Sprint 03 Documentation](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/Sprint03.md)

**Sprint 04:** Will concentrate on developing prototype web and mobile interfaces for the database. The interfaces will give volunteers an easy way to test database functionality and give humanitarian organizations participating in our **Data Partners** program a way to report aid activities. [Sprint04 Documentation](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/Sprint04.md)

**Sprint 05:** Will launch the project's **Data Partners Program** and begin helping NGOs and grassroots relief initiatives report their aid activities. [Data Partners Program Documentation](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/DataPartners.md)

# Project Documentation

We are organizing the project around **Sprints** that teams can work on simultaniously.

Altogether we will be building a **new IATI database** robust enough to power prototype AI applications and support needs reporting at scale, setting up a basic **user interface** to test and organizing a [Data Partners Program](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/DataPartners.md) to help aid organizations report their activities and needs in compliance with the IATI Standard.

Our principle objective is to create a new database where a need for one exists and to make it available for use to organizations and developers responsind to the Ukrainian war and escalating humanitarian crisis. For our community, the new database will enable us to carry out research looking at how IATI data can be employed by emerging AI applications and virtual assistants.

## Sprint 01: Create an IATI Publisher List

Sprint 01 will get the project started. It will establish the core portion of IATI Plus’s graph database and load information extracted from IATI’s Publishers List and from organization dataset pages. Next the Sprint will programmatically tackle how to keep core node information up-to-date.

Core nodes will principally serve IATI Plus and **Sprint 02** by storing metadata and URL addresses of all know IATI XML files published by IATI reporting organization from which data on aid activities can be extracted.

## Sprint 02: Develop an IATI Data Extractor/Updater

Sprint 02 will principally reasearch and develop ways of sourcing IATI data and ways to keep IATI Plus' database up-to-date

## Sprint 03: Setup and Launch IATI Plus Database

Sprint 03 will concentrate on researching and establishing a graphical database structure of IATI Plus and to set up the database and initially test it.

## Sprint 04: Setup User Interface

Sprint 04 will concentrate on developing prototype web and mobile interfaces for the database. The interfaces will give volunteers an easy way to test database functionality and queries and the user interface will give humanitarian organizations participating in our **Data Partners** program a way to test report aid activities. We'll use [IATIPlus.org](http://iatiplus.org) for the web interface.

## Sprint 05: Launch Data Partners Program

Sprint 05 will launch IATI Plus' Data Partners Program and begin helping NGOs and grassroots relief initiatives report their aid activities.

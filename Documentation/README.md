# Project Documentation

We are organizing this project around **Sprints** which serve as [milestones](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/milestones) each focusing on a distinct [project](https://github.com/orgs/Humanitarian-AI/projects/2/views/1?groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Milestone) area.

Altogether we will be building a **new IATI database** robust enough to support needs reporting at scale as well as power new prototype applications, setting up a basic **user interface** for mainly testing purposes and organizing a **Data Partners** program helping more aid organizations report their needs.

Our principle objective is to create a new database where a need for one exists and to make it available for use to organizations and developers responsind to the Ukrainian war and escalating humanitarian crisis. For our community, the new database will enable us to start work on research looking at how IATI data can be employed by emerging AI applications and virtual assistants.

## Sprint 03: Setup and Launch IATI Plus Database

## Sprint 04: Setup User Interface

This sprint will concentrate on developing prototype web and mobile interfaces for the database. The interfaces will give volunteers an easy way to test database functionality and queries and the user interface will give humanitarian organizations a way to test report aid activities. We'll use [IATIPlus.org](http://iatiplus.org) for the web interface.

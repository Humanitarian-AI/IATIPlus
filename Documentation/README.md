# Project Documentation

We are organizing the project around **Sprints** that teams can work on simultaniously.

Altogether we will be building a **new IATI database** robust enough to support needs reporting at scale as well as power new prototype applications, setting up a basic **user interface** for mainly testing purposes and organizing a [Data Partners Program](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/DataPartners.md) to help more aid organizations report their needs.

Our principle objective is to create a new database where a need for one exists and to make it available for use to organizations and developers responsind to the Ukrainian war and escalating humanitarian crisis. For our community, the new database will enable us to start work on research looking at how IATI data can be employed by emerging AI applications and virtual assistants.

Refer to our project wiki for [more information](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/wiki/IATI-Plus-Project).

## Sprint 01: Create an IATI Publisher List

This sprint will get the project started and concentrate on databasing basic organization information and the URL addresses of all know organization XML files.

## Sprint 02: Develop an IATI Data Extractor/Updater

Under Construction

## Sprint 03: Setup and Launch IATI Plus Database

Under Construction

## Sprint 04: Setup User Interface

This sprint will concentrate on developing prototype web and mobile interfaces for the database. The interfaces will give volunteers an easy way to test database functionality and queries and the user interface will give humanitarian organizations participating in our **Data Partners** program a way to test report aid activities. We'll use [IATIPlus.org](http://iatiplus.org) for the web interface.

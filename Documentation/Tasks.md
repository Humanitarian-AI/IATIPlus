[Convert IATI fields to graph labels and properties](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/issues/8) | We need to establish core graph database labels and properties. This issue contains a list of IATI standard XML elements and attributes that we need to convert into graph labels and propertise compliant with Neo4j naming conventions.

Generate core database labels and properties | We need to create proper labels and properties for core nodes and relationships, described in [Sprint 01](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Documentation/Sprint01.md). We're beginning to draft these fields via this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsKWmpqsm634d02fOz8WTwipteOjjLMSx_RcdU8-Kak/edit?usp=sharing).

Setup graph databases | We will be setting up two graph databases to later see if we can synchronize and keep up-to-date. We need to begin setting these up in order to start loading test data to evaluate. We will create a Neo4j instance on Digital Ocean and a Neptune instance on AWS.

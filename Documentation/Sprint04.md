# Sprint 04

![UI Functions](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/UI_Functions.png)

On a basic level, **IATI Plus**'s prototype user interface will serve as a reporting application similar to [AidStream](https://aidstream.org/) but as a simplified version. It will give staff from humanitarian organizations the ability to **view** aid activities reported by organizations in compliance with the IATI XML Standard, **report** new activities and **update** their IATI XML files.

Initially, the interface will give volunteers working on the project a tool to use to easily test database functionality, experimental information fields, queries and outputs.

## IATI Files, Activities, Fields and Authors

![IATI Files](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATI_structure.png)

Aid activity information reported by organizations in compliance with IATI is stored in XML files on organization servers. The files can contain information on one or more individual activities. The IATI XML Standard contains hundreds of element and attribute fields that can be used to detail and highly structure information on a granular level. IATI Plus' database will be configured to support key-value reporting and versioning at the individual author level which is something new. This will make it easier to spread and track activity reporting across teams and restrict information access through versioning and publishing phases.

## IATI XML Data

Information on aid activities reported in compliance with the IATI Standard is converted and stored in machine readable XML code. Here is a simplified file providing information on one activity and the activity's **Reporting-org**, **Title** and **Description**.

```XML
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<iati-activities generated-datetime="2014-09-10T07:15:37Z">
 <iati-activity xml:lang="en" last-updated-datetime="2014-09-10T07:15:37Z">
  <iati-identifier>AA-AAA-123456789-ABC123</iati-identifier>
  <reporting-org ref="AA-AAA-123456789" type="40" secondary-reporter="0">
   <narrative>Organisation name</narrative>
  </reporting-org>
  <title author="Author B">
   <narrative>Activity  version 2</narrative>
 </title>
  <title author="Author A">
   <narrative>Activity  version 1</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative>General activity description text.  Long description of the activity</narrative>
  </description>
</iati-activity>
</iati-activities>
```

IATI XML files are often generated and published by organization IT staff. **IATI Plus** is designed to serve non-technical staff, make reporting easier and making it possible for individuals to co-author and co-update aid activity files. The example XML code above contains two **Title** entries generated by different authors. IATI Plus is bringing co-authoring to IATI and ways of resolving conflicting updates.

## IATI Previewer

![Website Mockup](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATI_Preview.png)

IATI Plus' beta user interface will resemble an improved version of the IATI Registry's XML [Data Previewer](http://preview.iatistandard.org/index.php?url=https%3A//aidstream.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/xml/cnepal-activities.xml). Users will be able to enter search criteria such as names of aid organizations or locations where aid activities are being carried out to list activities and then select, open and expand activity files to view their details. With IATI Plus users will be able to further parse the previewer's semi-parsed XML into more easily readable text and do other new things like start or update activity files, message other authors and make donations to organizations.

## IATI Plus App Interface

![IATI Plus User Interface](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/App_mockup_screens.png)

Initially, we are concentrating on building a simplified website and simplified mobile app with four main screens. On a backend level, the user interface's different functions will make it possible to research, develop and test new XML field elements and attributes, data querying methods and etc. Creating a screen geared for donors will help us examine humanitarian fundraising fields for example and how information on needs and activities can be traversed to help raise aid funding.

## IATI Plus Website

![IATI Plus Website](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATIPlus_website.png)

The website will turn app screens into pages and menu items and size the screen larger. This approach will help us test app screen versions and functionality. Creating a screen geared for donors will help us examine humanitarian fundraising fields for example.

## IATI Plus: Preview

![IATI Plus Preview](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATIPlus_preview.png)

Like IATI's Previewer, IATI Plus users will be able to retrieve aid activity files using field headings and then open and expand the files. Via IATI Plus users will be able to search IATI using more fields as well as paste in complex query strings. Users will be able to execute queries by voice and also listen to result summaries. Although complex querying and voice and listening abilities will be limited initially, we are building in these capabilities to provide ourselves with frameworks to use to develop them further.

## IATI Plus: Report

![IATI Plus Report](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATIPlus_report.png)

Using IATI Plus' reporting screen/page users will be able to start new activity folders and files and update existing file information. They will also be able to add and experiment with adding and testing new field elements and attributes and set field visibility permissions. Users will be able to experiment with querying their files and listen to file summaries to help evaluate informational content.

## IATI Plus: Message

![IATI Plus Message](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATIPlus_message.png)

Depending on needs, users will be able to message other activity file authors and the authors of individual fields to resolve updating conflicts for example. Messages will flag questionable lines in red for example and ask for an update.

## IATI Plus: Donate

![IATI Plus Donate](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/IATIPlus_donate.png)

IATI Plus users will also be able to pledge support to aid activities and contribute to them. This ability will give us a way to test new fundraising and needs reporting field elements and attributes as well as test ways information on individual pledges and donations can be stored in XML.

## Design Documentation

We will be using a Google Doc to list website and app functions and UI/UX features for consideration.

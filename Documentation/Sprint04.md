# Sprint 04

![UI Functions](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/UI_Functions.png)

On a basic level, **IATI Plus**'s prototype user interface will serve as a reporting application similar to [AidStream](https://aidstream.org/) but a simplified version. It will give staff from humanitarian organizations the ability to view, create and update IATI XML files providing granular information on aid activities.

Initially though, the interface will give volunteers working on the project a tool to use to easly check and test database fundtionality, queries and connections.

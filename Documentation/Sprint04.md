# Sprint 04

![UI Functions](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/blob/main/Media/UI_Functions.png)

On a basic level, **IATI Plus**'s prototype user interface will serve as a reporting application similar to [AidStream](https://aidstream.org/) but as a simplified version. It will give staff from humanitarian organizations the ability to view, create and update IATI XML files providing granular information on aid activities.

Initially though, the interface will give volunteers working on the project a tool to use to easly check and test database fundtionality, queries and connections.

## UI/UX

Although we aim to keep our first user interface and apps simple, we are recruiting volunteers to help us design them and their different iterations. We are going to use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/6Psz3zI2WZcgGqgFDEeJfF/iOS-Mockup?node-id=0%3A1) to facilitate design collaboration.

## Website and Mobile App Screens

The project is going to work on three [mobile app](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/wiki/Mobile-Apps) user interface screens and one website. To keep UI/UX design work simple the website will mirror different screen views as menue itemas. The screens will closely resemble and function like IATI Registry's [File Preview Website](http://preview.iatistandard.org/index.php?url=https%3A//aidstream.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/xml/cnepal-activities.xml) which parses organization IATI XML files.

# Project Documentation

We are organizing this project around **Sprints** and [milestones](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATIPlus/milestones) focusing on distinct project areas.

Altogether we will be building a new IATI database robust enough to support needs reporting at scale as well as power new prototype applications, setting up a basic user interface for mainkly testing purposes and organizing a Data Partners program helping more aid organizations report their needs.

Our principle objective is to create a new database where a need for one exists and to make it available for use to organizations and developers responsind to the Ukrainian war and escalating humanitarian crisis. For our community, the new database will enable us to start work on research looking at how IATI data can be employed by emerging AI applications and virtual assistants.
